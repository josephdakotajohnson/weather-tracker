## Features

 - When the user clicks the generate password button, there is a prompt
    that asks the user the length of the password.
 - Next, there is a prompt that asks the user if there will be any lowercase,
    uppercase, numeric, or special characters in the password.
 - If the user inputs and invalid length or no characters, the user is
    given an error response and the application is discontinued.
 - A password is generated meeting the requirements set by the user.
 - I added notes stating what the different parts of the code in JavaScript
    do.
